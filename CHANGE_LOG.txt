   *
   *  3.1.2    17-JAN-2008 Commented out references to APPS environment and Oracle Applications enabled
   *		               environments
   *
   *  3.1.2    22-SEP-2006 Changed logic for current remote path logic on non-mainframe connections
   *                       where we picked up path using PWD command and then performed a CWD
   *                 	   we had to change because the humad\* accounts with backwards slash
   *                 	   throws the routine off. LTRIM RTRIM was changed to substr and instr
   *				   commands.
   *
   *  3.1.1    16-SEP-2006 Bug identified when download ASCII files. Originally, I built it to remove
   *                       unnecessary carriage returns that are created when users create csv files
   *                       in Excel. I accidentally removed this feature.

   *                       Additionally, expanded QUOTE SITE command to permit multiple
   *                       commands to be submitted separated by a | delimiter.
   *
   *                       Added dir and ls functionality

   *                       Requires that DBA_DIRECTORIES be utilitized
   *                       meaning that instead of passing local path
   *                       as a path, you must use your defined DBA_DIRECTORY
   *                       values e.g. INTF0047_TABLES is defined as /xfer/INTF0047
   *

   *                       Removed multiple file support. Couldn't seem to make it work right.
   *                       Added time_out setting which terminates session if it exceeds 4 minutes
   *                       Added functionality for remove and rename, and for sending as different filename
   *
   *                          -- To process a file as a different name use the # symbol
   *                          -- test.txt#test.txt20032801
   *                          -- Would be used if you wanted to send the file test.txt
   *                              but copy to remote server as test.txt20032801

   *  1.0.1    01/18/2003  Began testing code as proof of concept under 8i.
   *                       As delivered the code did not work correctly for our 8i environment
